## Welcome!

My name is **Yevgen Ryeznik**
<br/>(*UkrainianðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦: Ð„Ð²Ð³ÐµÐ½ Ð Ñ”Ð·Ð½Ñ–Ðº*).

I am a statistician working in the pharma industry, providing statistical support 
for the design and analysis of clinical trials.

I have a Ph.D. degree in _applied mathematics and statistics_ obtained at [*Uppsala University*](https://uu.se/) (Sweden) in 2019. The Ph.D. project was a part of the [*Center for Interdisciplinary Mathematics* (CIM)](https://www.math.uu.se/research/cim/) initiative. My supervisors were professor [*Warwick Tucker*](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=XX4412) from the [*Department of Mathematics*](https://math.uu.se/) and professor [*Andrew Hooker*](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N4-631) from the [*Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Pharmacometrics Research Group*](https://katalog.uu.se/organisation/?orgId=FF3:12).

My detailed CV is available [**here**](./cv.html). 

I am interested in solving research problems in _mathematics_, _(bio)statistics_, _pharmacometrics_, and _machine learning_ as well as in _statistical programming_ and _scientific computing_, using `R` and `Julia` programming languages.  

Also, [here](./teaching.html), you can find information about several courses, that I teach/taught.
