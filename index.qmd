## Welcome to my page!

My name is **Yevgen Ryeznik**
<br/>(*UkrainianðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦: Ð„Ð²Ð³ÐµÐ½ Ð Ñ”Ð·Ð½Ñ–Ðº*).

I work as a statistician at [*AstraZeneca*](https://www.astrazeneca.com) (Gothenburg, Sweden), where I provide statistical support for design and analysis of clinical trials.

Before joining *AstraZeneca*, I worked at [*Uppsala University*](https://uu.se/) (Sweden), where I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics and Statistics in 2019. The PhD project was a part of the the [*Center for Interdisciplinary Mathematics* (CIM)](https://www.math.uu.se/research/cim/) initialtive. 

My supervisors were professor [*Warwick Tucker*](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=XX4412) from the [*Department of Mathematics*](https://math.uu.se/) and professor [*Andrew Hooker*](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N4-631) from the [*Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Pharmacometrics Research Group*](https://katalog.uu.se/organisation/?orgId=FF3:12).

[**Here**](./cv.html), you can read my detailed CV. 

On this site, I [write](./blog.html) about mathematical and statistical problems and their solutions, which I have found to be interesting to me. Most of the solutions come with `R` or `Julia` code.  

Also, you can find here materials for several  [courses](./teaching.html), that I teach/taught.
